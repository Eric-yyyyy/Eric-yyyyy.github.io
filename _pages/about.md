I am a Junior Undergraduate Student Majoring in Computer Science at University of Rochester. 

I am interested in the field of HCI(Human-Computer Interaction) and MR(Mixed Reality), and I’m currently a Research Assistant at URCS BEAR Lab under [Professor Yukang Yan](https://rochester-bear-lab.github.io/yukang).
